                    January 2018 - present <br><br>
                    Our team of 5 front and backend developers and myself created LionPlanner as a part of the Penn State Nittany AI Challenge, which consisted of three phases: ideation, prototypes, and minimum viable&nbsp;products. 
                        <br><br>In September 2018, after developing an MVP, our team received first place and $30,000 of funding for further&nbsp;development.

                    <p class="problem-text">Academic planning is a crucial part of every college student's life. The problem is, it's just as complicated as it is crucial. This process involves many resources, often full of inconsistencies, many requirements to keep track of, and small mistakes can lead to huge&nbsp;obstacles.</p>

                    <p class="project-section-title">No Interactivity &rarr; A&nbsp;Tedious&nbsp;Task</p>
                    <p class="problem-text">The current solution is a template "recommended academic plan," which does offer some value in its suggestions for ordering courses. However, it really isn't helpful to students who don't fit the one major, four year mold, and its lack of interactivity makes accomodating any other circumstances incredibly&nbsp;tedious.</p>

                    <p class="problem-text">LionPlanner includes the many resources needed for this process including course descriptions, major requirements, prerequisites, and more, all on one&nbsp;page.</p>

                    <p class="problem-text">We know that a major issue with the current solution is how prone it is to human error, so we implemented functionality to check that all prerequisites are being met. If not, the design makes it clear that there is an issue and even displays how to correct&nbsp;it.</p>
                    <img src="lp-screenshots/errors.png" class="lp-screenshot">
                    <p class="img-caption">"Still Needed" serves as a reminder of courses a user removed and hasn't fulfilled&nbsp;yet.</p>

                    <p class="project-section-title">Familiarity + Interactivity</p>
                    <p class="problem-text">I chose to take a similar approach to the recommended plans for the semester design, because I know college students don't have time to learn totally foregin software. Adding the extra information and functionality to this design is where the impact of LionPlanner really&nbsp;shines.</p>
                    <img src="lp-screenshots/familiar.png" class="lp-screenshot">
                    <p class="img-caption">Adding interactivity to something students are familiar with gives LionPlanner a shallow learning curve, while maximizing its improvements on the current solution.</p>
                    <p class="project-section-title">Takeaways</p>
                    <p class="problem-text">Creating LionPlanner has solidified my love for being the bridge between user and developer. It has emphasized to me the power user-centered software has to make an impact on real lives, and how important empathy is to developing a useful product.<br><br>I've also learned a tremendous amount about working with a team to create an actual product and then taking it to market. Being at the forefront of our team's commmunications, presentations, and pitches has given me invaluable experience in the administrative side of the company that simply does not occur in a class project.</p>

                            As we continue to develop LionPlanner, adding some more features like a degree requirement checklist, we're looking at some very exciting prospects for getting our tool into the hands of students.
                            <br><br>
                            We're eager to see how many students we can help with this tool, and have even already received interest from two universities.
