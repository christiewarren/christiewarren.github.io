                        <h5>I may not have always known I wanted to be a designer, but I've always loved helping the people around me and 
                            making them happier. In high school my passion was musical theater, and the empathy necessary to portray characters unlike 
                            myself has very much stayed with me in my transition to design and in my life as a whole.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>I believe in always having a good sense of humor and never taking myself too seriously. 
                            That being said, I've also developed a solid work ethic, thanks to the rigorous Graphic Design program at Penn State. (oh, and my parents...hi guys! &#128075;)

                            <h5>Bouldering is by far my favorite way to stay active, and my favorite place to do it is the Philadelphia 
                                Rock Gym, near where I'm from. When I'm home for breaks, you can catch me at PRG every other day, toughing out the 
                                blisters I got while I was away.

                            I still call him Kitten. (Of course I also love my dogs, but I've got limited real estate here.)</h5>

                                landscapes to people, events, animals, and more. Nature is still my favorite thing to capture, but I always 
                                remind myself to put my camera down and take it all in through my eyes.
