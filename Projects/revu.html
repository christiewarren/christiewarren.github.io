                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <h4>User Interviews</h4>
                    <p>Initially our idea for Revu was to make it a tool for students to study with and stay focused while reading out 
                        of class assignments. After interviewing multiple students and speaking with professors, it became clear that this 
                        tool would be much more impactful if it were in the hands of teachers.
                        <br><br>The problem lies with students not reading out of class in the first place, not with their studying habits. This phase 
                        showed us that it would be tough to motivate students to read, unless their teachers got involved.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Defining a Solution</h4>
                    <p>The biggest obstacle to designing Revu was determining how to incentivize students to do these readings. Extra credit is a 
                        possible incentive, but the professors and educators we spoke with didn't like the idea of rewarding students for doing what they 
                        signed up for (understandably).

                        <h4>Summary</h4>
                        <h5>Designing Revu gave me extensive experience with each part of the design process from basic user research, to ideation, 
                                to mockups and prototypes, all while collaborating with a full stack developer. I also got to improve my public speaking and communication skills, 
                                specifically explaining the functionality of Revu. 
                        </h5>
                        <h4>Next Time...</h4>
                        <h5>This project emphasized the importance of user research, and how it can change the direction of a product. If I could redo this process, 
                            next time I would do more research sooner, to make sure the design is steered in the "right" direction from the start.
