                    Branding: November 2016 - January 2017 <br>Web: June 2018 - Present<br><br>
                    I first started working with Roddy Restoration &amp; Remodeling when they were looking to redefine their brand in 2016. At that time I created a logo and some print designs&nbsp;for&nbsp;them. 
                    <br><br>In June 2018, I began working with them again, this time to create a website for customers to view their info and previous&nbsp;work</p>

                    <p class="project-section-title">Customer Relationships are Key</p>
                    <p class="problem-text">It's so important to build good customer relationships in the construction industry. Still, a lot of these companies don't have user-friendly websites, and in today's world, being a customer without proper online info is incredibly&nbsp;frustrating.<br><br>I want customers to understand exactly what the company does at a glance, and see the quality of the work.</p>

                    <p class="project-section-title">Bringing Personality to the Roddy Name</p>
                    <p class="problem-text">The people on this team, Steve especially, are really personable and care a lot about the work they do and who they do it for. I want to convey this through the site, so customers know who they're talking to and who's behind&nbsp;The&nbsp;Name.</p>

                    <p class="project-section-title">Basic Info + The Facts</p>
                    <p class="problem-text">A site like this should be straightforward rather than complex, and helpful rather than intriguing. I asked Steve to tell me, from his experience, what is the most important information customers want to know, and this is what we came up with.<br><br>Without being too cold or too cheesy, this page conveys the value of the team and the restoration services they&nbsp;offer.</p>

                    <p class="project-section-title">Showing Over Telling (In Progress)</p>
                    <p class="problem-text">This page may look a bit empty, because most of it will be taken up by a gallery of before an after images of the work Roddy's team has done. <br><br>Remodeling is very much about the look and feel of the work, so showing customers what Roddy can do should convince them of their value without using too much text.</p>

                    <p class="project-section-title">A Simple Contact Process</p>
                    <p class="problem-text">I dedicated an entire page to contact, because this is one of the most important aspects of a company's site. It doesn't matter how well a customer is convinced of your value if there's no way to get in&nbsp;touch.</p>

                    <p class="project-section-title">Takeaways</p>
                    <p class="problem-text">Designing for the Roddy team has allowed me to learn so much about brand consistency and how important it is to make that brand true to the people it&nbsp;represents.<br><br>I've also learned how to better narrow information down to the most important details, while still maintaining a personable tone throughout the&nbsp;design.</p>

                        <p class="future-text">
                            This site is still a work in progress, and the next step will be to go to some of the team's previous jobs to get some more photos of the quality work they do. <br><br>As always, I'm really enjoying working with this team, and I'm excited to give them more of a presence online.
