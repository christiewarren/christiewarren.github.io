                                are my designs from wireframe to final prototype, with medium/hi-fi's between. During this process I grew more accustomed to the 
                                standards of <span class="skill">interface design,</span> and how to <span class="skill"></span>best use (and not use) screen space</span>. My sense of <span class="skill">web typography</span> and 
                                <span class="skill">color palettes</span> also 
                                improved, as I learned to apply my graphic design knowledge to a new medium.

                        <h5>When I'm asked at what point I became sure that I wanted to do UI/UX design, I always point to LionPlanner. Not only was this project impactful 
                            because of its scale and how much I learned, but it also showed me the potential design & tech have to help people. I truly loved 
                            helping solve a real issue and hearing people say how much it would have changed their experience. 
                        </h5>
                        <h4>Next Time...</h4>
                        <h5>The major challenges our team faced during this project were with communication among a large team of college students. If we were to do the project over again, I would make sure to establish clear roles on our team, 
                            including how much each member would like to contribute. Navigating conflicts that arose was absolutely a learning experience that changed the way I now approach collaboration.
