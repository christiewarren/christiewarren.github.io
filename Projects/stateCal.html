                        <h4>Summary</h4>
                        <h5>This project was very useful for learning how to use user research to guide the direction of an application. Even in this 
                            situation, where I am very similar if not the same as the user base, some of the findings in my research were not what I 
                            expected. This emphasized to me that no matter how well I think I know the user, it's always important to ask questions 
                            in an unbiased way to accurately help them solve their problem.

                        <h5>If I could redo this project over a longer time frame, I'd like to incorporate more creativity in the visual design. Since 
                            I was primarily focused on the user flow and experience of the app, I didn't have too much time to try out less conventional 
                            designs, and I think this app could benefit from that to make it more appealing to college students.
