                            <h5>Since the clients on this project were very research driven, it was important that we include spaced learning as a tool 
                                to help students learn better. Essentially, students will receive a set of questions and continue receiving them on a set schedule 
                                until they get them all correct.

                        <h5>For this project, our clients' expertise lay largely in research, so I often needed to justify my design decsions, 
                            as I favored a user-friendly interface over detailed data visualizations. Being prepared to reason with our clients and make compromises when 
                            necessary was extremely valuable, and I found that my extensive critiquing experience really helped with this process. Transforming 
                            a broad, grandiose concept into a concrete interface and flow was also great experience, and required a lot of discipline from 
                            our end.

                        <h5>This being my first client project, I learned how important it is to be responsive 
                            to clients. Our clients were particularly enthusiastic and would complete the "homework" we asked them to do and then some, 
                            so at a point our team wasn't keeping up with the clients' updated documents. If I were to do this over, I'd reign in the design 
                            process until I was completely certain of the clients' expectations in order to make better usage of everyone's time.
