                <h3>Studying Graphic Design at Penn State has taught me so much about giving and receiving constructive criticism 
                    and developing concept-driven work. Below are a few of my favorite pieces I've created here.

                            I chose the 2016 film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, and was responsible for finding and photographing a model, 
                            assembling multiple outfits, designing a 6-spread layout, and handcrafting the magazine.

                            and figurative imagery. I chose to do a campaign for The Pill Club, a subscription service that delivers 
                            birth control pills along with a care package of useful items.

                        <h3>Growth Anamorphic Mural</h3>
                        <h5>Our group worked on a project to activate a space with typography and communicate a message about the space. 
                            The three of us collaborated to design a mural that inspires the students in our program to focus on the process and growth 
                            rather than the grades they receive. We assembled it with hand cut decals that were distorted so that the mural can only be read 
                            from one specific perspective.
